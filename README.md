# Array-Easy
*An array is a data structure, that contains a group of elements. Typically these elements are all of the same data type, such as an integer or string. Arrays are
commonly used in computer programs to organize data so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.

*In the mathematical concept of a matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional grid, two-dimensional arrays are also sometimes called matrices. In some cases the
term 'vector' is used in computing to refer to an array, although types rather than vectors are the more mathematically correct equivalent. Tables are often 
implement in the form of arrays, especially look up tables; the word table is sometimes used as synonym of array.

*Arrays are used to implement other data structures, such as lists, heaps, hash,tables, deques, stacks, strings, and lists. Array-based implementations of other
data structures are frequently simple and space-efficient (implicit data structures), requiring little space overhead, but may have poor space complexity,
particularly when modified, compared to tree-based data structures (compare a sorted array to a search tree).

*When data objects are stored in an array, individual objects are selected by an index that is usually a non-negative scalar integer. Indexes are also called
subscripts. An index maps the array value to a stored object.

*Array can have multiple dimensions, thus it is not uncommon to access an array using multiple indices. Forexample, a two-dimensional array A with three rows and
four columnsmight provider access to the element at the 2nd row and 4th column by the expression A[1][3] in the case of a zero-based indexing system. Thus two indices
are used for a two-dimensional array. Three for a three-dimensional array, and n for an n-dimensional array.

/// Advantages of Arrays:

1. An array implementation allows print to be carried out in linear time and find operation in constant time, which is good as can be expected.

2. Random access is possible.

3. Implementation of list using array is easier as compound to other implementations.

/// Disadvantages of Arrays:

1. Elements of arrays are always stored in contiguous memory.

2. Inserting or deleting an element in an array may require all of its elements to be shifted.

3. The size of array is always fixed.

4. You cannot add a new elements beyond the end of the array.

5. Memory for entire array is always reserved even though you use only part of the array.

6. You must guess the expected maximum size of the list in advance.
